# GraphQL Restaurant Exercise

## Application to Display Restaurant Data and Edit Data via GraphQL

### Creating multi-tier applications means building multiple API endpoints to handle different data operations. The more complex your application becomes, the harder it is to maintain all these endpoints. GraphQL aims to reduce this complexity by providing a simpler view of data and making it easier to query it. 

### Your task is to set up GraphQL for your restaurant data and then add mutations to get and update these data. 

### 5 Queries were mainly the focus:
    restaurant: This gets a single restaurant based on a provided ID. 
    restaurants: This gets a list of all restaurants. 
    setrestaurant: This creates a new restaurant. 
    Deleterestaurant: This deletes a restaurant based on the provided id.
    editrestaurant: This updates a restaurant based on the provided id.
